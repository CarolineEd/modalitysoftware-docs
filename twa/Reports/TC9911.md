# Guest Distribution

User Story: I can find out how many teams have Guests, whether the team is Public, Private or Hidden, and if itâ€™s active or inactive. 

This report tells me:

- The number and percentage of teams, by number of Guests
- The percentage of Guests in Public, Private or Hidden teams
- The percentage of Guests in Active vs Inactive teams

Filter by Team, Owner, Guest or Guest Domain.
