# Teams Summary
User Story: I can find all the top-level information I need to understand Teams usage within my organisation.

This report tells me:

- Licensed vs Active Users
- How Users are distributed across Country, City, Department and Office
- Total number of Chat Messages, Team Messages, Calls Joined and Meetings Joined
- Average daily count of Messages, Calls and Meetings by activity threshold

Understand the mix of activity; filter by Department or Office to see the differences at a more local level and identify the highest ratios behind the aggregated averages.
