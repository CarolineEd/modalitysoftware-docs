# Team Creation and Status

User Story: I can find out how many new teams have been created over time, by whom and where the Owners are located.

This report tells me:

- Teams created to date
- How active those teams are (Messages in last 30 days)
- Number of teams per Country, City and Department
- Team Visibility (Public/Private/Hidden) and Archive status

View the year on year increase/decrease in teams created. 

Understand the number of archived teams, whether theyâ€™re Public, Private or Hidden; where Owners are located and how many teams each Owner is responsible for.
