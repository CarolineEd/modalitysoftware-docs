# Trend Report - Per User Activity Weekly

User Story: I can find out the moving average number of Chat and Team Messages, Calls and Meetings per User, per week over the last 12 weeks.

This report tells me:

- How the level of activity fluctuates over time
- The mix of User activity, and whether patterns correlate between modalities
- Whether seasonality affects the weekly moving average per User

Weekly moving averages per User represent overall productivity and engagement within Teams. Each trend line can be analysed to show which factor(s) most influenced day-to-day change.
