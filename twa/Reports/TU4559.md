# Device Usage

User Story: I can find out which types and category of device are used for Teams activity and where their Users are located.

This report tells me:

- Which device types are being used
- Device category breakdown
- How Users of each device type are distributed across

Compare number of devices per type and the categories they fall into by Country, City, Department and Office. 

View a complete listing of device type(s) per User.
