# Device Usage

User Story: I can find out the number of users per type and category of device. 

This report tells me:

- Which device types are being used
- Device category breakdown
- The percentage of device type usage per country and department

Compare number of devices per type and the categories they fall into by country, city, department and office. Device filter is available for activity breakdown.
