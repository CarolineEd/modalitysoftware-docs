# Users and Attributes

User Story: I can find out where each User is located, and whether Custom Attributes have been assigned to them in the Active Directory

This report tells me 

- Which Country, City, Department or Office each User is located in
- Whether Custom Attributes have been assigned to a User and, if so, which ones

Filter by User to highlight their location and attributes.
