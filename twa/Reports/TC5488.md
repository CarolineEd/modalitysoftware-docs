# Per Team Profile

User Story: I can find out how engaged and collaborative a team and its Members are, and where the team is located. 

This report tells me:

- How Users are engaging 
- List and number of Members and Messages per team
- Level of engagement by team or by location (Country, City, Department, Office)
- Teams Messages sent within last 30 days

Overall engagement refers to the percentage of Members who have posted Messages in a team. 

Review Team Messages, New Threads, Replies, GIFs and Reactions, Attachments, @Mentions over the last 24 weeks. 

View Team Members by the number of Team Messages posted. 

Understand engagement at Country, City and Department level; drill through to see Users and attributes.
