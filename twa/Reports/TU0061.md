# Relative User Activity

User Story: I can find out how relative activity thresholds are calculated, and view the monthly average per User, per modality

This report tells me 

- How active Users are grouped into 'Very High', 'High', 'Medium' and 'Low' activity thresholds
- The variation between number of User average Chat and Team Messages, Calls and Meetings at different activity thresholds
- The number of e.g. Calls joined per month by the average 'Medium' activity User 
- How an increase in number of Users in e.g. the 'Low' activity threshold affected the average count of monthly Meetings joined 

Filter by Country, City, Department and Office to compare usage at local or global level.
