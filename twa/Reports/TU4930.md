# Trend Report - Per User Activity Monthly

User Story: I can find out the monthly moving average number of Chat and Team Messages, Calls and Meetings per User, per month over the last 6 months.

This report tells me:

- The affect of seasonality on average User activity, per modality
- Average User activity per day, by modality
- The mix of User activity, and whether patterns are emerging between and within modalities

Monthly moving averages per User provides an overview of the four core Teams activities over time; compare graph shapes to understand collaboration and usage at Country, City, Department or Office level.
