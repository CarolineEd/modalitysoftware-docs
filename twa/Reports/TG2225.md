# Apps

User Story: I can find details of Apps in teams, and teams with Apps. 	

This report tells me: 

- How many teams use a certain App
- Number of teams by App count (banded 1-30, 31-40, 41-50, >50)
- Details of Apps installed per team

View number of teams by App, and the number / percentage of teams by number of Apps.

Review a list of apps, with version details and number of teams itâ€™s been installed for.
