# Owners of Teams with Guests

User Story: I can find teams with Guests, and view the Ownerâ€™s Country, City, Department and Office.

This report tells me:

- Number of teams with Guests
- Owners of teams with Guests
- Whether teams with Guests are active or inactive
- Which teams with Guests are archived
- Which Guest teams have sent Messages within the last 30 days

Team Details show visibility, archive status, Team Message recency, Owners and Guests. 

View number of Teams with Guests by Owner, Country, City and Department.
