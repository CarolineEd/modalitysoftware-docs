# Weekly Active Users

User Story: I can find out how engagement differs between modalities on a weekly basis.

This report uses colour-coded activity thresholds to tell me:

- Which Users might need help or training
- The effect of seasonality on User numbers and levels of activity
- Who the most engaged Users are, and where (Champions)
- How many Users are actively engaging with Chat Messages, Team Messages, Calls and Meetings

See ‘Explain Activity Thresholds’. 

Review daily activity, aggregated to weekly level for a smoother picture of User engagement over time.
