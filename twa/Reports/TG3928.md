# Governance Reporter

User Story: I can find out which teams are out of compliance and don't follow best practice.

This report tells me: 

- Whether a team is Public / Private / Hidden
- Team Archive status
- Teams with duplicate names or empty descriptions
- Number of Channels per team
- Whether Messages were posted within the last 30 days
- Teams without Owners
- Number of Guests per team

Multiple filters enable granular analysis of team details, Owners, Members and Guests, with traffic light guidance to indicate risk.
