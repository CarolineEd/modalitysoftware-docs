# Active User Percentages All Bands

User Story: I can find out the percentage split of Users by Country and Department across all modalities, at each one of four activity thresholds.

This report tells me:

- The percentage of Users of e.g. Chat Messages that fall into Very High, High, Medium and Low activity thresholds
- How the split of modalities changes at each activity threshold

See ‘Explain Activity Thresholds’. 

In this example, 8.70% of all the UK’s Chat Message Users, and 6.82% of its Team Message Users fall into the Very High Activity band. 
Change activity threshold filters to understand how the remaining Users are split between High, Medium and Low.
