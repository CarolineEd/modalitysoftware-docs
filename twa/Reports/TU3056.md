# Daily Active Users

User Story: I can find out how User activity differs between modalities on a daily basis. 

This report uses colour-coded activity thresholds to tell me:

- How activity thresholds differ by day of the week
- How many Users are engaging with each modality, and to what degree

See ‘Explain Activity Thresholds’. 

Understand at a granular level how many Users are contributing to each threshold for Chat Messages, Team Messages, Calls and Meetings.
