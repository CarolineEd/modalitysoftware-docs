# Active User Percentages

User Story: I can find out the percentage of Users in each Country and Department who fall into each one of four activity thresholds, per modality.

This report tells me:

- The percentage of Users within a certain activity threshold for each modality (Chat and Team Messages, Calls and Meetings)
- How well represented a Country or Department's Users are in each activity threshold

See ‘Explain Activity Thresholds’. 

In this example (Very High activity), Chat Messages are principally sent by UK Users (50%), 40% don’t have a Country listed against them in the AD, and the remaining 10% are in Australia. 
At Department level, ‘Consulting UK’ has the highest % of Very High Users of Chat Messages.
