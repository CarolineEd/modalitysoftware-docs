# Active User Counts

User Story: I can find out the number of Users in each Country and Department who fall into each one of four activity thresholds, per modality.

This report tells me:

- The number of Users of Chat and Team Messages, Calls and Meetings in Very High, High, Medium or Low thresholds
- How well represented a Country's Users are at each activity threshold, per modality

See ‘Explain Activity Thresholds’. 

In this example (Very High activity), 10 of the 20 Users of Chat Messages are from the UK, 8 don’t have a Country listed against them in the AD, and the remaining 2 are in Australia. 
At Department level, ‘Consulting UK’ has the highest number of Chat Message Users.
