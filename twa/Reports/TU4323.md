# Trend Report - Activity Counts Weekly

User Story: I can find out how many Chat and Team Messages, Calls and Meetings there are per week and review change over time.

This report tells me:

- Average daily number and weekly total per modality
- Whether there's a pattern of engagement by week or over the 12 week period, indicating behavioural change

Trend lines can be compared with Weekly Active Users to understand periods of low or high activity within the User base, and filtered to Country, City, Department or Location for deeper analysis.
