# Trend Report - Daily Active Users

User Story: I can find out how daily usage levels differ by activity type, over time.

This report tells me:

- How many Users are collaborating per modality
- Whether there's a pattern of engagement for each activity type

Compare graph shapes to look for correlation between User numbers and days of the week.
