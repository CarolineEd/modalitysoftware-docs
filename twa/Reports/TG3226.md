# Guest Details

User Story: I can find Guests by name, domain or team and identify the associated Owners.

This report tells me:

- Number of Guests and Guest domains
- How many teams have Guests
- How many Team Messages Guests have sent 
- Who owns teams with Guests
- Whether Guests have access to files within a team

View Owners of teams with Guests, number of teams a Guest has joined, and number of teams by Guest domain. 

Understand the Guests and Guest Domains in a team; whether that team is Public or Private and how active it is (archive status, Messages and Files).
